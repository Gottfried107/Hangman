# Hangman
Hangman game I created to practice list and string manipulation.
Please feel free to suggest improvements, I just started learning programming.
I found the word list at the following link: 'https://www.randomlists.com/data/words.json'.
I removed words with less than 3 letters and words that contained the character '-', as it was the only character which was not a letter. Is there an easy way to generalize the check to all the characters which are not letters? Thanks.
